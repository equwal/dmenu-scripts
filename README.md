# My dmenu scripts

[website](https://therealtruex.com/posts/dmenu-scripts-repo-released)

[dmenu](https://tools.suckless.org/dmenu/) is a simple program with a
pretty selection window for X. These are my scripts for doing things
with that.

- `dbc`: do `bc -l` on the input so you can do math
- `dbrowsel`: select a browser for the link in the clipboard to open
- `dcpupower`: select CPU throttling settings
- `ddmenu`: use dmenu to select a dmenu script -- dception
- `dmenu_run/dsudo`: run programs, maybe from a keybind set with xbindkeys or a wm
- `dmenupass`: ask for the sudo password as SUDO_ASKPASS
- `dmount/dunmount`: mount/unmount drives
- `dopenrc-runlevel`: choose openrc runlevels for various advanced tasks like networking
- `drssadd`: add RSS links to the newsboat config from clipboad
- `dshow`:  run a command and show output without having to open a terminal
- `dsysact`: reboot/shutdown/etc.
- `dtimer`: a coffee timer. Check out [uniformativ.de](https://www.uninformativ.de/git/countty/file/README.html)'s countty for a non-dmenu one.
- `dtmpl`: copy template files from a directory into the clipboard
- `passmenu`: unix [`pass`](https://www.passwordstore.org/) interface, copies to clipboard.
- `passmenu-otp`: like passmenu but copies the OTP code to clipboard.
- `y-or-n`: ask if yes or no
