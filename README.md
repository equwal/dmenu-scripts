# My dmenu scripts

[dmenu](https://tools.suckless.org/dmenu/) is a simple program with a
pretty selection window for X. These are my scripts for doing things
with that.

- `dbc`: do `bc -l` on the input so you can do math
- `dbrowsel`: select a browser for the link in the clipboard to open
- `dcpupower`: select CPU throttling settings
- `ddmenu`: use dmenu to select a dmenu script -- dception
- `dmenu_run/dsudo`: run programs, maybe from a keybind set with xbindkeys or a wm
- `dmenupass`: ask for the sudo password as SUDO_ASKPASS
- `dmount/dunmount`: mount/unmound drives
- `dshow`:  run a command and show output without having to open a terminal
- `dsysact`: reboot/shutdown/etc.
- `passmenu`: unix [`pass`](https://www.passwordstore.org/) interface
- `y-or-n`: ask if yes or no
